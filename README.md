# Anomaly-Detection-Using-LSTM-Autoencoder
 NYC Taxi Traffic Anomaly Detection Using LSTM Autoencoder
This project implements an anomaly detection model for NYC taxi traffic data using LSTM autoencoders. 
The goal is to identify periods with unusual traffic patterns, which could signify unexpected events, 
errors, or disruptions.
The NYC Taxi Traffic dataset contains passenger counts recorded every 30 minutes between July 2014 and February 2015. 
It provides a time-series dataset ideal for anomaly detection tasks
